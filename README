Implementation of Shell in C.
An user interactive shell with some commands such as:
	pwd
	echo
	ls
	pinfo
	cd
and also running of processes both foreground and background.

For executing multiple commands separate them by ';'.

For running a process in background enter command and & after that
	Ex: firefox &
	it will return process id 
	and when it is closed by user it will prompt
	message saying that.
